# Car-Insurance-Project

Designed a complete system for Car insurance and claims for an insurance company with following constraints.
A car is insured for one-year duration and a policy in issued. If existing policy is renewed, different
policy number is issued. Each car is having only one insurance policy. A car is owned by only one owner
and policy is issued in ownerâ€™s name. When a car meets with an accident, a claim is filed by owner of
the car for damage/repairing cost. Repairing is done by a car workshop and claim is having details of
workshop also for particular claim. In a claim, driver details are also captured who was driving the car
at the time of accident (owner can be driver also). Complete details about car make, model, year,
engine no., chassis no. , etc ate also captured.
